# Lean Touch (by Carlos Wilkes)

u2vis use parts of LeanTouch to support touch input for interacting with bars. It was created by Carlos Wilkes who also gave permission to include it in this project. It can be found in the Unity Asset Store at: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/lean-touch-30111

Note: If you don't need touch input for your project, you may remove LeanTouch, but you have to remove or alter the InputManager as well to no longer depend on LeanTouch.
